Designed a website to provide 360 degree care to pregnant women, 24/7. Below are a few features of our website. There are other many more features too.

According to a survey conducted, 1 out of every 17 miscarriages happen due to a lack of awareness and information about pregnancy and its needs. 

A solution to provide digital pregnancy support accessible to pregnant women specifically in India, regardless of caste, creed, race, religious, socioeconomic, cultural, and geographical background, using Artificial intelligence.
Here's a presentation for our solution :

2. the urban women

Overview : 
 Guided a team of 3 to design a website providing 360 degree care to pregnant women. Modeled a Web Scraper
to scrape ASHA workers’ data from Govt. website. Built a Chatbot for round-the-clock queries.
◦ Programmed a Health Status Prediction Model to predict user’s health status, trained using Random
Forest Classification Algorithm for tracking and displaying data of Hospitals within 20 km proximity of
current location in real time.
◦ Designed and integrated three other features including a Mood Tracker for insightful mood analysis, Song
Playlist Player leveraging scientific Alpha and Beta wave music for optimized listening and a Digital Journal.

4.	Note-taking feature for journalling their pregnancy journey
5.	Scientifically approved songs’ playlists for mood upliftment and for soothing, calming, and positive effects.
